		      	<p>The website provides a convenient way for patients to book appointments for consulting a doctor according to their preferences.</p>
		      	<p>Doctors can register by providing necessary details regarding  specialization, location, time slots available for  consultation at each location, maximum number of appointments at each location and a password for logging in later. Once registration is complete, the doctor will be provided a unique DoctorID which is to be used along with the password to log and make any modifications to their prior entries. The details of a registered doctor will be available to the patient for booking appointments.
				The patient has the option to choose from a variety of search criteria, namely, doctor name, specialization, location,  to find a doctor and book appointments. Upon fixing the appointment, the user will be provided with a booking ID which is to be produced 30min before the allotted time at the appropriate location to confirm the appointment.</p>
